# Problem 1

## Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel Sheet

``` r
trash_wheel = read_excel("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = 1, range = "A2:N408") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls, digits = 0)
  ) %>% 
  filter(!(str_detect(month, "Total")))
```

## Read and Clean Precipitation data for 2018 and 2019

``` r
rain_2019 = read_excel("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = 4, range = "A2:B14") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    na.omit %>% 
    mutate(
      year = 2019
    )
rain_2018 = read_excel("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = 5, range = "A2:B14",) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    mutate(
       year = 2018
    )
```

## Combining Precipitation data sets

``` r
rain_data = bind_rows(rain_2018, rain_2019) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = month.name[month]
  )
```
